## Reflection üìù

### **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

To write programs in a maintainable readable and adaptable way is to is to seperate backend logic from front end logic as well as ensuring each function is doing one sepcific thing with good naming conventions. This not only makes the code easier to read and debug but allows it be be easily adjusted to be resused in future projects. 

### **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

When given a problem the first step is to understand what the client wants breaking down the requiremnts into more manageable steps. Once planning is done each requirement should be the focal point of the devlopment process.

### **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer Scientists solve problems in an efficient way by creating new technology that the average person can use to make thier life easier. The dashboard application created for Grazioso Salvare is much easier to query than working with a MongoDB and will require a samller learning cuvre and just fimilairity with the dashboard.
